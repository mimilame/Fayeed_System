We, the interns at Fayeed Electronics, were tasked with the development of an information system for our organization. This project spanned from May 31 to July 13 in the academic year 2023, aligning with the Practicum/Immersion course at the College of Computing Studies, Western Mindanao State University.

## System Overview
The system encompasses four user roles: admin, branch manager, inventory staff, and regular staff. These roles are interconnected to establish a functional and efficient system that fulfills its specific requirements. The project empowers branch managers to oversee and record checkout transactions within their branches, manage personnel, monitor staff logs, and track inventory levels. Notably, this system streamlines the attendance tracking process, allowing personnel to log their attendance remotely rather than in person.

Furthermore, the inventory manager plays a crucial role by assigning tasks to general staff members for assessing open assemblies upon sale. This process automatically deducts assembly components from the inventory database, ensuring the accuracy of inventory alerts. The admin, on the other hand, has the authority to resolve inter-branch issues, approve personnel attendance, and perform qualitative analytics on yearly or monthly sales data. Both the admin and branch managers can add personnel to facilitate specific tasks upon login.

2. Extract the ZIP file to your desired folder
3. Import the SQL file located in `fayeed_electronics.sql` into your MySQL database 
4. Configure your database credentials in `connection.php`
5. Host the files on your server and access through your domain
6. Register as a new admin user to get started  

### 2. Fork the Repository 

1. Click "Fork" in the top right to fork this repo
